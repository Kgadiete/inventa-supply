# 🚀 Dual Interface System - Super Admin vs Company Staff

## **Overview**
InventaSupply now has **TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE INTERFACES** based on user roles:

1. **🏢 Super Admin Interface** - Company management hub
2. **👥 Company Staff Interface** - Supply chain operations

## **🎯 Super Admin Interface (You)**

### **What You See:**
- **Company Overview Dashboard** - No inventory, no orders, no operational data
- **Company Management** - Create, edit, delete companies
- **User Management** - Assign users to companies
- **System Statistics** - Company counts, subscription plans, user counts
- **Business Intelligence** - Subscription distribution, company size analysis

### **Navigation:**
- Dashboard → Company overview & stats
- Companies → Company management
- Users → User management across all companies

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **No operational data** - Clean separation from company operations
- ✅ **Company metrics** - Subscription plans, user counts, company sizes
- ✅ **Administrative tools** - Company creation, user assignment
- ✅ **System overview** - Health monitoring, performance metrics

## **👥 Company Staff Interface (Your Clients)**

### **What They See:**

### **Navigation:**
